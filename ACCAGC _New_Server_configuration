step 1-- we have install iib /ace 
step 2-- log4j
step 3-- syslog
step 4-- odbc.ini
step 5--  sql drivers


INSTALL IIB /ACE 
dwonlaod tar file 
untar it 
accept linces 
take mqsimyprofile path and add in .bash_profile(app/IIB.12.0.12.5/ace.12.0.12.5/server/bin/mqsiprofile add this path in .bash_profile and save it then run mqsilist to check that mqsi is running or not)
why we add in . bash_profile ?
because when ever a user start teh server the bash_profile file runn and your mqsiprofile commands also automatically get runs (if we don"t then we have manually run mqsiprofile every time when we start server)
. bash_profile is hidden file (to see ls -a)



LOG4J
log.cdtc file
xml file 
three jars in applications

SYSLOG(to see system log means suppise your started stoped )
write mail to idm team and we provide the path for sys log they will configure
var/log/user.log

ODBC.INI 
frist of all we need a driver when ever we want to connect to any database( for eg odbcoracleconnector or odbcmysqlconnector)
after we get driver we have to put this deriver in lib floder (app/IIB.12.0.12.5/ace.12.0.12.5/server/ODBC/drivers/lib)
then we have come in odbc.ini file and add the stanza we want 
dsn name
driver_path=app/IIB.12.0.12.5/ace.12.0.12.5/server/ODBC/drivers/lib/odbcmqsqlconnetor
sid,user,password
MQSISETDBPARMS brokername -n DSN -u user -p Password 
Mqsicvp brokername -n DSN to check that dsn get connected or not 
restart broker 

add 
EXPORT ODBCINI=/name/finshare/odbc.ini file  path in .bash_profile
